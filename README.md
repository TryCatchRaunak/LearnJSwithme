# LearnJSwithME
Here I will be learning the whole language of JAVASCRIPT as in general - starting from the basics all the way up to advance concepts - Thanks to Apna College for mentoring my Journey through and I hope to put this forward in their gratitude for future aspects.
**THIS REPO ALSO INCLUDES MINI PROJECTS WHICH I MADE DURING THE COURSE OF LEARNING JS.**
